      <h2>Montioring Window Messages</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>You can monitor messages sent to a window by right clicking on
      that window in the tree and selecting "Messages...".<br />
      A window will open displaying any further messages that the selected
      window receives. You can view the message names (as defined by Windows)
      as well as their parameters (wParam and lParam) and return result.</p>

      <h3>Filtering Messages</h3>
      <p>Often you will be looking for specific messages sent to the window. For
      this case, Window Detective can exclude messages that you are not interested
      in, so you can focus on the ones you are interested in. Clicking the filter
      button <img class="icon" src="images/icons/filter.png"/> will open the
      "Filter/Highlight Messages" dialog on the filter tab. Here you can select
      which messages to include or exclude.
      <h3>Highlighting Messages</h3>
      <p>In addition to filtering messages, you can also highlight messages in
      the list. The foreground (text) colour and the background colour can be
      changed for specific messages, so that you can easily identify them in the
      list. Clicking the highlight button <img class="icon" src="images/icons/highlight.png"/>
      will open the "Filter/Highlight Messages" dialog on the highlight tab. Here
      you can add or remove highlights, select which type of message they are applied to,
      and choose the highlight colours.</p>
      <p>In the example below, highlights for three types of messages have been added:
      WM_PAINT, WM_MOUSEMOVE and LVM_GETITEMW (a ListView message).</p>
      <table align="center"><tr>
        <td class="screenshot">
          <img src="images/set_highlights.png" />
          <p>The Filter/Highlight dialog, showing a number of highlights.</p>
        </td>
        <td class="screenshot">
          <img src="images/highlighted_messages.png" />
          <p>An example of the highlights applied to the messages.</p>
        </td></tr>
      </table>
      <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Filters and highlights are only applied to
      messages that are recieved <i>after</i> those filters or highlights are set.</p>
