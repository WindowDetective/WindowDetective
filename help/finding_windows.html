      <h2>Finding a Window</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>If you cannot locate a window in the tree or on screen, you can search
      for it using the find dialog. To open the find dialog, click the find icon
      <img class="icon" src="images/icons/find.png" /> or press Ctrl-F.
      </p>
      <p>You can search for a window either by it's text/title, handle or class.
      <table class="optionlist">
        <tr><td><span class="option">Text:</span></td>
        <td>A string or sub-string to search for in the window's text (if it is a
        top-level window, this will be it's title).</br>
        Tick the "Case Sensitive" check box to search matching the case.</br>
        Tick the "Regular Expresion" check box to use regular expression matching.</br>
        The type of regex syntax used depends on the settings, see
        <a href="./preferences_general.html#regex">Regex Preference</a>
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td><span class="option">Handle:</span></td>
        <td>The HWND handle of the window to search for.
        This can be either an integer in base 10 (decimal) or base 16 (hexadecimal).
        </td>/<tr>
        <tr><td><span class="option">Class:</span></td>
        <td>The name of the window's class. The list of all registered classes are
        available in the drop-down list.
        </td></tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      <p>
      After you have entered the appropriate criteria, click the "Find" button.
      If a single window is found, it will be located and highlighted in the
      hierarchy tree. Otherwise, a results dialog will be shown listing all windows
      found. These windows are displayed in a list with columns similar to that in
      the hierarchy trees.</br>
      You also have the option of repeating the search by clicking the "Repeat
      Search" button on the results window. This will re-run the search and update
      the list with the new results. This can be useful if some windows were changed
      since you first ran the search.
      </p>
