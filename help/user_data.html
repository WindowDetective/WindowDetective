      <h2>Defining Custom Window Data</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      Various parts of Window Detective can be customised by editing files in the
      user appdata directory. The following sections list each asset under that
      directory, what they are used for, and how to modify or add to them.
      <p class="info">In Windows XP, the user data directory is:
      <code>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>&lt;username&gt;</i>\Application Data\Window Detective\</code><br />
      In Vista and Windows 7, it is:
      <code>C:\Users\<i>&lt;username&gt;</i>\AppData\Roaming\Window Detective\</code>
      <h3>Window Messages</h3>
      <p>File: <code>data\window_messages.ini</code></p>
      <p>In addition to the system messages, applications can define their own
      message to use for communicating with their own windows, or for communicating
      with other applications.
      For example; <a href="http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/">Process Hacker</a>
      (another great open-source project) defines custom messages for it's graph
      window class.</p>
      <p>If you want Window Detective to recognise such messages, and display their
      name instead of just the id, then you can add them to window_messages.ini</p>
      <h3>Window Class Icons</h3>
      <p>Directory: <code>data\window_class_icons\</code></p>
      <p>Image files under this directory are used by Window Detective as icons
      for window classes. These icons are shown in the window tree.</p>
      <p>You can add images for custom window classes, or to override Window
      Detective's image for system classes. The name of the file must be the same as
      the name of the window class you wish to use it for (case-sensitive), and
      the format must be either PNG or ICO.</p>
