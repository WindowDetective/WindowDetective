Each language will have it's own folder. The files that go in those folders are the .ts files
and compiled .qm files. The build script will search these folders and use any files
it finds. /data and /help folders will also contain "translations" folders which contain
different language translations of some or all files in those folders.

For each .ts file in /src/translations the build script will build an installer. It will look in
/data/translations and /help/translations for any files, those files will be used instead of the
normal English versions. If files don't exist in the translations folder, the default will be used.

The script will probably have to build the .iss file in order to make it generic for all translations.
It will build a string and write it to a temp file, which will then be passed to Inno.
