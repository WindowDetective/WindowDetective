   --==  Window Detective 0.0.1beta ==--

This is the first release of Window Detective. It is still in beta and not yet complete, but it still has
enough features and few enough bugs to be usable. So go ahead and try it out :)

Window-Detective-0.0.1b-setup.exe
    This is the Window Installer package that will install Window Detective

Window-Detective-0.0.1b-src.zip
    This zip file contains the source code as well as the pre-compiled binary (exe).
    No installation is required to run, although settings will not be saved.

If you downloaded the source code, you will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and the Qt framework to
compile it. Qt is relatively easy to install and setup, you can download version 4.6 from
