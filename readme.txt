Window-Detective-0.0.3-setup.exe
    This is the Window Installer package that will install Window Detective

Window-Detective-0.0.3-src.zip
    This zip file contains the source code as well as the pre-compiled binary (exe).
    No installation is required to run, although settings will not be saved.

If you downloaded the source code, you will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and the Qt
framework to compile it. Qt is relatively easy to install and setup, you can download
version 4.6 from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp-vs2008
