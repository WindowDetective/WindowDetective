// This file maps each window style id to it's name as used in the Windows API.
// Styles are grouped by the window classes they are used for, these classes
// are the built-in Windows controls.
// There is also additional information such as what other styles each one either
// must or must not be used with.

// -- File Format --
// Each style is defined by a comma separated list as follows:
//   id, name, isExtended, depends, excludes, description
// Group names are a comma-separated list of class names which
// the styles apply to, or "all" if they are generic styles.
// Note: The group names must not contain any spaces
